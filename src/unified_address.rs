/// A multi-protocol Zcash address that can contain components from different Zcash protocols.
///
/// `UnifiedAddress` represents Zcash's next-generation addressing format that allows bundling
/// multiple receiver types (transparent, Sapling, Orchard) into a single encoded string.
/// This enables wallets to generate one address that can receive funds via any supported
/// protocol while hiding the underlying complexity from users.
///
/// # Zcash Concept Relation
/// Unified Addresses (UAs) were introduced in ZIP-316 and deployed with NU5 (Orchard
/// network upgrade). They address several limitations of individual address types:
///
/// - **Simplified User Experience**: Users see a single address (starting with "u1...")
///   rather than dealing with multiple address types
/// - **Forward Compatibility**: New receiver types can be added without breaking existing UAs
/// - **Protocol Agnostic**: Senders don't need to choose which protocol to use; their wallet
///   can select the most appropriate one based on capability
/// - **Progressive Privacy**: Transactions automatically use the best privacy technology
///   available to both sender and receiver
///
/// Each UA contains one or more "receivers" from different protocols (transparent, Sapling,
/// and/or Orchard). When funds are sent to a UA, the sender's wallet selects the most
/// private protocol that both wallets support.
///
/// # Data Preservation
/// During wallet migration, the following components are preserved:
///
/// - **UA string**: The full unified address string when available
/// - **Diversifier index**: Used to deterministically derive addresses from keys
/// - **HD path information**: For addresses derived from hierarchical deterministic wallets
///
/// # Implementation Note
/// In Zcash wallets, unified addresses are not typically stored directly in wallet.dat files.
/// Instead, wallets store the metadata needed to derive UAs at runtime:
/// - Diversifier indices
/// - Information about which receiver types to include
/// - References to the keys used to derive the addresses
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// # use zewif::{UnifiedAddress, Blob};
/// // Create a new unified address
/// let mut ua = UnifiedAddress::new("u1exampleaddress".to_string());
///
/// // Set a diversifier index (used in address derivation)
/// let diversifier_data = [0u8; 11];
/// let diversifier_index = Blob::new(diversifier_data);
/// ua.set_diversifier_index(diversifier_index);

/// This function provides a standardized implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm
/// used throughout Zcash protocols for various cryptographic operations, including transaction

///
/// # Zcash Concept Relation
/// In Zcash (and other cryptocurrencies):
///
/// - **Transaction IDs**: Generated using various hashing schemes, often involving SHA-256
/// - **Merkle Trees**: Used for efficient verification of transaction inclusion
/// - **Block Headers**: Hash-chained together using SHA-256 based functions
/// - **Address Generation**: Involves hashing of public keys and other components
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `data` - The data to hash, which can be any type that implements `AsRef<[u8]>`,
///   such as `&[u8]`, `Vec<u8>`, or `String`
///
/// # Returns
/// A `u256` containing the 32-byte hash result

/// Computes a double SHA-256 hash (SHA-256 applied twice) of the provided data.
///
/// This function applies the SHA-256 algorithm twice: first to the input data,
/// then to the result of the first hash. This double-hashing approach is derived
/// from Bitcoin and is used in Zcash's transparent transaction components to maintain
/// compatibility with Bitcoin's hashing model.
///
/// # Zcash Concept Relation
/// In Zcash's transparent protocol components:
///
/// - **Transaction IDs**: Computed using double SHA-256 of the serialized transaction data
/// - **Block Headers**: Include a double SHA-256 hash of the previous block header
/// - **Merkle Roots**: Constructed using double SHA-256 for each tree level
///
/// Double hashing provides enhanced security against length-extension attacks
/// that can affect single-round SHA-256.
